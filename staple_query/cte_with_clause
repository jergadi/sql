The Common Table Expressions or CTEâ€™s for short are used to simplify the readability of complex joins and subqueries.
It is basically a temporary named result set that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.


WITH idtempp as (
  SELECT id as id
  FROM id 
  WHERE country = "US"
  AND status = "Y"
)

SELECT *
FROM bill
WHERE id in (SELECT id from idtempp)
