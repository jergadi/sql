You often come across scenarios where you have to calculate a running total from a table. This is to know what each value is, against a running total.
A running total refers to the sum of values in all cells of a column that precedes the next cell in that particular column.

SELECT id,month
 , Amount
 , SUM(Amount) OVER (ORDER BY id) as total_sum
FROM bill
